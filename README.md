# screeps-snippets
This repository is for saving pinned snippets from the [#client-abuse](https://screeps.slack.com/messages/client-abuse/), [#help](https://screeps.slack.com/messages/help/), [#logging](https://screeps.slack.com/messages/logging/), [#share-thy-code](https://screeps.slack.com/messages/share-thy-code/) slack channels and any other important slack snippets from elsewhere for posterity.

If you want to contribute, please PR your additions.

The folder structure is broken into 6 primary categories:

- client-abuse
- classes
- globals
- logging
- misc
- prototypes

Each category is further divided into various languages

- JavaScript
- TypeScript

Other languages are welcome (e.g. kotalin) if people want to share their code. Simply throw the file in a new language folder in the primary category.

There will be a voting system installed for automatically merging PRs once this is further established. More details to follow...
